# Democratic Republic of Congo - Ebola Dashboard

Recreating part of the [WHO ArcGIS Dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/e70c3804f6044652bc37cce7d8fcef6c) with Openlayers and ChartJS. The idea is to highlight the information about cases and process the data client-side to avoid loading times after each interaction.
